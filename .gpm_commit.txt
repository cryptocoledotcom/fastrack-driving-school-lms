docs: add Google Password Manager as primary credential option 
 
- Updated TEST_CREDENTIALS.md to recommend Google PM (free, built-in) 
- Added comparison table for all credential options 
- Updated CLAUDE.md and NETWORK_RESILIENCE_TESTING.md references 
- Added setup time and recommendations 
 
For solo developers: Google PM or Firebase Emulator UI are simplest
