feat(compliance): enforce security questions before course access and fix dual-environment dev setup

## Summary
Implemented route-level compliance enforcement requiring security questions before course player access, and fixed environment-specific development setup to allow simultaneous testing on both production Firebase (port 3000) and emulators (port 3001) without data loss.

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Dual-Environment Development Setup (vite.config.js, .env)
- Enhanced vite.config.js to assign ports based on VITE_USE_EMULATORS environment variable
  - Port 3000 (default): Production Firebase for integration testing
  - Port 3001: Firebase Emulators when VITE_USE_EMULATORS=true
- Removed hardcoded VITE_USE_EMULATORS=true from .env file
- Allows running two dev servers simultaneously without shutdown/data loss

Usage:
  Terminal 1: firebase emulators:start && VITE_USE_EMULATORS=true npm run dev  # Port 3001
  Terminal 2: npm run dev                                                       # Port 3000

### 2. Security Questions Compliance Route Guard (New Component)
- Created ComplianceRequiredRoute.jsx as new route guard
- Blocks access to /course-player/:courseId if user lacks security questions
- Displays compliance banner explaining Ohio requirements
- Provides one-click navigation to security tab with state parameter
- Files:
  - src/components/guards/ComplianceRequiredRoute.jsx (85 lines)
  - src/components/guards/ComplianceRequiredRoute.module.css (87 lines)
  - src/components/guards/index.js (updated export)

### 3. Route Integration (App.jsx)
- Wrapped CoursePlayerPage with ComplianceRequiredRoute
- Ensures security questions are set before any course access
- Routes: <ProtectedRoute> → <ComplianceRequiredRoute> → <CoursePlayerPage>

### 4. Settings Page Security Questions Persistence (SettingsPage.jsx)
- Fixed data structure mismatch in loadUserData()
  - Was looking for: securityData.questions (array) - doesn't exist
  - Now reads: securityData.question1, question2, question3 (flat fields)
- Pre-populates security question dropdowns when users return to settings
- Answers remain cleared for security (only hashed versions stored)
- Matches actual Firestore document structure

### 5. Dashboard Banner UX (DashboardPage.jsx)
- Updated security questions banner button to use navigate() with state
- Now navigates directly to /dashboard/settings with tab=security parameter
- Matches ComplianceRequiredRoute button behavior for consistency
- Added useLocation import for state parameter access

### 6. Heartbeat Timestamp Fix (TimerContext.jsx)
- Added lastHeartbeatTimestamp: Date.now() to heartbeat updates
- Cloud Function checks lastHeartbeatTimestamp (milliseconds) not lastHeartbeat (ISO string)
- Session inactivity timeout (15 minutes) now properly detects idle state
- Heartbeat runs every 5 minutes: updates both ISO string and millisecond timestamp

## Testing & Verification

✅ Tested & Working:
- ComplianceRequiredRoute blocks unauthenticated course access
- Banner navigates to security tab directly
- Settings page pre-populates existing questions
- Dashboard banner uses correct navigation
- Build passes (3,015 modules, 1,678.78 kB)
- Dual-port setup allows simultaneous emulator + production testing

⏳ Pending Tests:
- Full 15-minute inactivity timeout verification (scheduled for next session)
- Firestore inspection of lastHeartbeatTimestamp field updates

## Compliance Impact

- 100% Ohio OAC enforcement: No student can access courses without security questions
- Every student pathway blocked until compliance questions configured
- Clear UX with education about compliance requirements
- Consistent navigation experience across dashboard and protected routes

## Environment Variables

Default behavior changed:
- BEFORE: VITE_USE_EMULATORS=true in .env (always used emulators)
- AFTER: VITE_USE_EMULATORS not set or false (default to production Firebase)
- Override at runtime: VITE_USE_EMULATORS=true npm run dev (uses emulators)

## Related Issues

Fixes production bugs discovered after Week 2 Phase 5.3 completion:
- Issue: Inactivity timeout not enforcing (users could stay logged in indefinitely)
- Issue: No route-level enforcement of compliance requirements
- Issue: Dev workflow required shutdown to test production integration
