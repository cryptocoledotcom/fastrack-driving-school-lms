security: remove Stripe secret key from environment file

- Removed VITE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY from .env.emulators
- Secret keys must NEVER be committed to repositories
- Only publishable keys should be in version control
- Secret keys must be set via environment variables on server only
- GitHub push protection caught this security violation

IMPORTANT: The secret key (sk_test_...) must be rotated immediately on Stripe dashboard
