docs: fix Google Password Manager instructions - use Chrome Settings instead 
 
- Corrected: Google PM is for viewing passwords, not creating 
- Added accurate Chrome Settings method (Settings > Passwords and passkeys > Add) 
- Updated comparison table to list Chrome Settings as easiest option 
- Updated CLAUDE.md and NETWORK_RESILIENCE_TESTING.md 
 
Chrome Settings is the simplest approach: free, 1 min setup, auto-fill built-in
